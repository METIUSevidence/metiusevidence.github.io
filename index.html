  <h2>About METIUS</h2>
  <p>METIUS is a £11.5 million UKRI-funded infrastructure initiative designed to revolutionise how scientific evidence is synthesised and delivered to policymakers in the UK and globally..</p>
  <ul>
  <li>We will create new breakthrough AI and open data infrastructure to make evidence synthesis faster, cheaper, and more relevant to policymakers' needs in the UK and globally.</li>
  <li>We will develop new research methods to tackle some of the biggest needs of policymakers using evidence synthesis e.g., applying evidence from one context to another; answering the large-scale questions, and assessing and making the most of varied research, evaluations and other evidence types</li>
  <li>We will engage with policymakers to understand their needs, and to promote evidence usability and use</li>
  <li>We will deliver exemplar projects of living evidence synthesis in four areas of national and international importance: education, crime and justice, climate, environment, and society, and sustainable development.</li>  
</ul>
  <p>The overall result will be a flexible infrastructure that can be applied across the whole of social science and public policy. Allied to this will be a growing network of organisations engaged in promoting and using evidence synthesis to inform decision making</p>
