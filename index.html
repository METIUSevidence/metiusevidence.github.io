  <h2>About METIUS</h2>
  <p>Billions of people could be better off if we used the evidence and research funding available more effectively. 
  </p>METIUS is a £11.5 million UKRI-funded infrastructure initiative designed to revolutionise how scientific evidence is synthesised and delivered to policymakers in the UK and globally. It will help policymakers achieve better results for less money by providing timely summaries of the state of the current knowledge through a transparent scientific process known as evidence synthesis. This work is urgently needed to help achieve the missions and priorities of all levels of UK government; to support the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals; to help the world tackle the climate crisis; and to help individuals, businesses, and local decision-makers around the world to achieve their goals. Our current inability to utilise research effectively is compromising our collective ability to develop effective policy.</p>
  <p>To address this, we will:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Create new breakthrough AI and open data infrastructure to make evidence synthesis faster, cheaper, and more relevant to policymakers' needs in the UK and globally.</li>
  <li>Develop new research methods to tackle some of the biggest needs of policymakers using evidence synthesis e.g., applying evidence from one context to another; answering the large-scale questions, and assessing and making the most of varied research, evaluations and other evidence types</li>
  <li>Engage with policymakers to understand their needs, and to promote evidence usability and use</li>
  <li>Deliver exemplar projects of living evidence synthesis in four areas of national and international importance: education, crime and justice, climate, environment, and society, and sustainable development.</li>  
</ul>
  <p>The overall result will be a flexible infrastructure that can be applied across the whole of social science and public policy. Allied to this will be a growing network of organisations engaged in promoting and using evidence synthesis to inform decision making</p>

 <h2>Strategic Partners</h2>
  <p>METIUS is linked to major global initiatives advancing evidence-informed decision-making, including the Evidence Synthesis Infrastructure Collaborative (ESIC) 
    and the Global Sustainable Development Goals Synthesis Coalition.</p>
  
  <p>The <strong>Evidence Synthesis Infrastructure Collaborative (ESIC)</strong> is a global alliance
     dedicated to strengthening the production, coordination and use of high-quality evidence
     synthesis. ESIC connects governments, research funders, UN entities, and evidence producers
     to build distributed, AI-enabled infrastructure supporting timely and actionable evidence
     for policy and practice.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Global SDG Synthesis Coalition</strong> is a multi-agency United Nations
      initiative bringing together over 40 UN entities and partners to synthesise evaluation
      evidence in support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Coalition identifies
      what works, why and for whom, accelerating progress towards the 2030 Agenda.</p>
